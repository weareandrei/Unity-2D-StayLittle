PLAYER CONTROLLR : ///
- Attach the platfomer controller script to your character
- Make sure to have a rigidbody2D & 2D Box Collider to your character / if you use circle collider 2D then change the it in the script too
- Make sure to have a "Ladder" tag and a ladder layer and asigne it in the player controller in the inspector and use it in anything you want player to climb in
- Make sure to have a wall layer for anything you want the player to do walljump on it or wall slide .. in this exemple we used the ground layer as a wall , it works too

CAMERA : ///
- Create and empty game object 'Camera Holder' and asigne the camera to it as a child (You can skip this stap if you dont use camera shake script)
- Attach the CameraManager script to the Camera Holder and not to the main camera (You can skip this stap if you dont use camera shake script)
- Attach the player to the camera script in the inspector
- Attach the CameraShake script to the main camera and call the function "Shake()" from any script to do a camera shake (You can skip this stap if you dont use camera shake script)
- Make sure to have Animation component in the main camera and attach the camera shake animation to it and uncheck play auto

PLAYER STATE & ANIMATIONs : ///
- Animations are easy to add with a boolean for every player state (Running , walking , in air , falling , climbing , Dashing ... )
- You can delete the player state script or you can use it to update the animations

** I Recommend you to use the exemple scene as a prototype and start from it to avoid further mistakes **

ENJOY
